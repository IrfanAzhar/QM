The Holy Quran was revelaed in Arabic language around 1400 years ago. The arabic alphabets carry distinct weights in matter  of numbers. In this project the weights of individual letters,  words, verses, chapters and complete holy book are calculated. Those interested to explore the patterns of these numerical weights may benefit from this repo.
